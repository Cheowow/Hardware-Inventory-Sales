# CODING STANDARDS

## Introduction

This document describes the coding standards for the project.
The purpose of this document is to ensure that the code is written in a
consistent manner
and is easy to read and maintain.

## Rules

1. Do not use indirect recursion.
2. Format the code before comitting changes.
3. Follow the modular structure of the codebase.
4. If possible, only create a function if a logic is used for at least three times.
5. Code first, then abstract later.
