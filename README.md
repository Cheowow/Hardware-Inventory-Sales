## Database Design

As much as possible, lessons from the video titled, ["How to Fake a Database Design - Curtis Poe (‎Ovid‎)"](https://youtu.be/y1tcbhWLiUM?si=TuftIGFaH6Z4yeMF) are followed.
The database design is fairly straightforward and small. Refer to this [diagram](https://dbdocs.io/workemailaaronragudos/murico) to see how it's structured.
